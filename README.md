SNES emulator written in Rust. This is a heavy work in progress and will probably never be released as a viable/usable emulator.

Why am i doing this?
 - Its a ton of fun!
 - I don't know anything about hardware or emulation and this is a deep dive into a lot of topics I wouldn't normally learn about
 - I like Rust but haven't written many large programs in it
 - I really enjoy/appreciate video games and its a fun project to dissect how they're working.

As this project makes some more progress, I will update this README with some more details of its different modules.
